Raw Data - there are 2 datafiles:

File 1 -- PM2.5 Emissions Data (summarySCC_PM25.rds): This file contains a data frame with all of the PM2.5 emissions data for 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008. For each year, the table contains number of tons of PM2.5 emitted from a specific type of source for the entire year. Here are the first few rows.

  fips: A five-digit number (represented as a string) indicating the U.S. county

  SCC: The name of the source as indicated by a digit string (see source code classification table)

  Pollutant: A string indicating the pollutant

  Emissions: Amount of PM2.5 emitted, in tons

  type: The type of source (point, non-point, on-road, or non-road)

  year: The year of emissions recorded
  
File 2 -- Source_Classification_Code.rds): This table provides a mapping from the SCC digit strings in the Emissions table to the actual name of the PM2.5 source. The sources are categorized in a few different ways from more general to more specific and you may choose to explore whatever categories you think are most useful. For example, source “10100101” is known as “Ext Comb /Electric Gen /Anthracite Coal /Pulverized Coal”.
